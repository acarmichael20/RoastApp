# RoastApp
A shiny app that provides cooking times for beef oven roast

### Backround
For several years, I have been using a spreadsheet to estimate the cooking time of oven roasts.  The data used to estimate cooking times comes from [Canada Beef](https://canadabeef.ca/oven-roast-know-how/)  

### Problem
Recently, I passed the spreadsheet on to a family member and while trying to show them how to use it, realized the spreadsheet was clunky and not user friendly.  

### Solution
I have created a Shiny app that takes:
- roast doneness, ie. rare, medium, well
- roast weight in kg
- intended meal time

and produces simple instructions including time and temperatures to cook the roast.
