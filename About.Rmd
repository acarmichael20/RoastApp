## Oven Roast Calculator

Thanks for trying the Oven Roast Calculator aka _Roasticulator_.

The data used to calculate cooking time came from [Canada Beef](https://canadabeef.ca/oven-roast-know-how/)

The code for this project and others can be found at [Github](https://github.com/acarmichael20)
